    with_fixtures [:x, :y] => :location do
      filters({ 
        :location => [:to_s, ] 
      })

      it 'should detect point (:x, :y) to :location (:msg)' do |input, location|
        Point.new(input[:x], input[:y]).detect_location.should == location

== Description
Test::Base is a perl testing library. It make you writing test simple and elegant with many data. RSpec is cool to write a test when it has many context, but it was too boring to write a simple testing with many data. So, I write this.
